<h3 id="provenance">Provenance</h3>

<p>This mosaic originally decorated the floor of a Roman villa in one of two
adjacent rooms, both with similar mosaics, discovered on the Via Emanuele
Filiberto in Rome. The site was excavated by Angelo Pasqui in 1910, but it is
uncertain when the mosaic was removed.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> It was purchased by the J. Paul Getty
Museum in 1971.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="commentary">Commentary</h3>

<p>A colorful female bust is the only polychrome feature in this otherwise
black-and-white mosaic. Snakes around her neck and serpentine locks of hair
identify her as the Gorgon Medusa. The image decorates the central medallion of
the mosaic, with the face turned upward and to the right. An elaborate geometric
pattern encircles the bust: concentric bands of alternating black-and-white
triangles decrease in size as they spiral toward the center, creating the
optical illusion of spinning motion. The design has also been interpreted as a
shield of scales, a reference to the aegis worn by Athena, a scaly mantle
decorated with the head of Medusa. A <em>guilloche</em> border around the circle is
enclosed within a second, square <em>guilloche</em> that outlines the entire
composition. <em>Kantharoi</em> fill the triangular spaces at each of the four corners.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, the Gorgon Medusa was a fearsome monster who turned viewers
to stone with her gaze. When she was finally killed—beheaded by the hero
Perseus—her hideous head was presented to his patron goddess, Athena. The Gorgon
head was a popular apotropaic device in Greek art, as its terrifying appearance
was believed to ward off evil. In Roman art, however, Medusa was humanized and
more clearly female; at times she was even depicted in the form of a beautiful
woman. During the Roman period, the image of the Gorgon often served a primarily
decorative function in interior decoration, appearing, for example, on domestic
utensils and wall paintings, but it continued to be regarded as a protective
symbol. Representations of Medusa were often accompanied by imagery related to
the god of wine, Dionysos, whose worship invoked pleasure and good fortune. The
<em>kantharoi</em> found in the corners of the Getty mosaic are closely associated with
the revelries of Dionysos. A Roman mosaic from &ldquo;Kisamos,&rdquo;, on Crete, similarly
depicts the central bust of Medusa surrounded by panels of masks and followers
of Dionysos.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> An explicit connection appears in a late second-century AD
mosaic pavement from a Roman villa at Corinth, which features the head of
Dionysos at the center of the same pattern found on the Getty mosaic and a
<em>guilloche</em> border with <em>kantharoi</em> in the corners.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The Getty’s Medusa mosaic originally decorated a small room measuring 3.6 × 2.9
meters. A pendant mosaic (fig. 1) survives from an adjacent, larger room (5.3 ×
4.5 meters) of the same villa; it was most likely made by the same workshop and
is now in the collection of the Museo Nazionale Romano—Palazzo Massimo alle
Terme.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> This second mosaic depicts the bust of Medusa in mirror image, her
gaze turned upward to the left. Her head is also placed at the center of a
black-and-white shield or spinning wheel design. Birds perch on branches in the
four corners instead of <em>kantharoi</em>, and a pattern of stylized tendrils and
ornate scrolls frames the <em>guilloche</em> border. The excavation of this villa
revealed that the two rooms originally formed one large rectangular chamber
decorated with a black-and-white mosaic of a marine scene before it was
subdivided and redecorated with the pair of Medusa mosaics.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Although the
reason for the renovation or reconstruction of the villa is unknown, the
construction of the building in <em>opus mixtum</em>, a technique used especially
during the rule of the emperor Hadrian from AD 117 to 138, indicates that the
transformation likely took place sometime in the early second century AD.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>
The style of the mosaics is typical of private villas in Italy during this
period, which were decorated predominately with black-and-white mosaics made up
of complicated, often curvilinear geometric patterns and highly stylized floral
designs.</p>

<h3 id="comparanda">Comparanda</h3>

<p>The circular geometric design with the Gorgon head at its center was used
frequently on mosaic pavements throughout the Roman Empire. Many were colorful,
polychrome compositions. In second-century AD mosaics from Piraeus in Greece and
Pergamon in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), the triangles of the scale pattern
are rendered in shades of red, blue, green, and yellow, with a <em>guilloche</em>
border in yellow and blue.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:8"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> The example from Pergamon</span>, like the Getty
mosaic, also displays <em>kantharoi</em> in its four corners. In a variation on the
spinning aspect of the design, the curvilinear triangles encircling the head of
Medusa in a late second-century AD mosaic floor from the House of the Red
Pavement at Antioch form concentric petal shapes.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> Scale patterns could also
be composed of shapes other than triangles. A mosaic from the *triclinium of a
Roman villa at Marcianopolis in Thrace (present-day Devnya, in Bulgaria), known
as the House of Antiope, displays Medusa within a circular pattern of
spade-shaped scales surrounded by a meander pattern, with felines in
each of the corners.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:10"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> Comparable examples from North Africa include a Roman
villa at Thysdrus (present-day El Djem) and a bath complex at Dar Zmela, both
characterized by a similar pattern of spade-shaped scales and flower motifs in
the corners, as well as the Great Baths at Thaenae, (present-day Thina), decorated with
radiating waves of alternating colors.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:11"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> An unusual version of this design in
<em>opus sectile</em> was discovered at in southern Turkey, where it covered the floor
of the orchestra of an <em>odeion</em> or <em>bouleuterion</em> that was destroyed in the
fifth or sixth century AD.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:12"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> Although other examples of the shield or
spinning wheel motif appear in <em>opus sectile</em>, all feature a geometric pattern
in place of the head of Medusa. One of these, executed in polychrome marble, was
found in the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum, the famous Roman villa that
inspired the design and decoration of the Getty Villa in Malibu.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:13"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="condition">Condition</h3>

<p>The central medallion is largely intact, but the edges, including the two
vessels in the lower half of the mosaic and much of the border, appear to be
modern reconstructions. Reportedly, the mosaic was already badly damaged when it
was discovered.</p>

<li id="fn:1">For the excavations of the villa, see Pasqui 1911, 338–39. It seems that the mosaic may have been reburied and lifted later. Period photographs in the Getty curatorial files, including one labeled “Casa dei Neroni,” show the mosaic as the floor of a modern house, but the location and previous owner have not yet been identified.
