<p>The mosaics of Italy first appeared in the late second century BC under the
influence of the Hellenistic Greek pictorial tradition, in which tiny pieces of
irregular stone were used to create narrative themes in detailed, colorful
compositions that imitated the effects of painting.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The earliest examples of
this type, most of which were <em>emblemata</em>, or picture panels, were either
introduced to the region by Greek craftsmen or manufactured elsewhere and
imported. Found predominantly in the cities around the Bay of Naples and Rome
mosaics in this style, such as the well-known Alexander Mosaic from the House of
the Faun at Pompeii and the Nile Mosaic from Palestrina, both dating to about
100 BC, were considered expensive luxury items, reserved exclusively for the
decoration of the wealthiest constructions. Smaller <em>emblemata</em> were usually
centerpieces of floors, and they were typically surrounded by plain white
tesserae or framed by simple decorative patterns. On some later floors, the
figural scene was set in a more elaborate design, such as in the House of the
Labyrinth at Pompeii, which features an <em>emblema</em> of Theseus and the Minotaur
dating to about 70–60 BC and framed by a black-and-white labyrinth pattern.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>By the end of the first century BC, the production of mosaic pavements in
various new Roman styles became widespread throughout Italy. The tremendous
expansion in the use of mosaics to decorate both public and private buildings
resulted in a number of different types that ranged from colorful figural scenes
to predominantly black-and-white geometric and floral patterns.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> The Villa of
the Volusii Saturnini at Lucus Feroniae, north of Rome, includes both styles:
polychrome mosaics in a phase of the villa dated to about 60–50 BC contrasting
with black-and-white pavements from the period of about AD 10–20.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Black-and-white style mosaics, like the Getty’s Mosaic Floor with Head of Medusa
(cat. 1), however, became increasingly common by the late first century AD,
especially in Rome and central Italy.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Complex geometric designs, like the
intricate pattern of curvilinear triangles encircling the bust of Medusa in this
mosaic, now covered the floors of entire rooms. Stylized vegetal motifs, used in
similarly themed compositions, such as the detailed floral pattern that
surrounds the central head of Medusa in a mosaic decorating the floor of the
<em>triclinium</em> in the House of Bacchus and Ariadne at Ostia, were equally
prevalent.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Although this new decorative style may have served as a less
expensive solution to the more costly tesserae required for polychrome mosaics,
in the second century AD black-and-white patterned mosaics of extremely high
quality were also used in the decoration of Hadrian’s Villa at Tivoli and in the
Palazzo Imperiale at Ostia.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The growing popularity of the black-and-white mosaic style in Italy in the first
and second centuries AD had a strong impact on mosaic designs outside of Italy,
particularly in the Roman provinces of Gaul and North Africa. The introduction
and diffusion of this style in these regions in the first century AD can most
likely be attributed to the increasing Roman presence in the region; itinerant
craftsmen traveled or settled in the area and established workshops for mosaic
production. Around the beginning of the fourth century AD, however, provincial
workshops exerted a profound influence in Italy, even in Rome itself, bringing a
new preference for large-scale scenes of the hunt or the arena to luxurious
Italian villas. The Getty’s fourth-century AD Mosaic Floor with Bear Hunt (cat.
2), from a seaside villa near Baiae on the Bay of Naples, exemplifies this new
style, which was particularly characteristic of mosaics in North Africa during
this period. The North African influence is also evident in the Great Hunt
mosaic at Piazza Armerina in Sicily and in a hunting mosaic from the Gardens of
Licinius on the Esquiline Hill in Rome, both dating to the early fourth century
AD, which in turn derive from the third-century AD hunting mosaics, such as
those from Carthage, Thysdrus (present-day El Djem), and the Villa of the
Laberii at Oudna.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:8"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>

<li id="fn:1">This technique, known as <em>opus vermiculatum</em>, appeared as early as the third century BC in Sicily and then spread north throughout Italy. On the origins of these types of pavements, see the discussion in Phillips 1960, 243–62. For a general history of mosaics in Sicily, see von Boeselager 1983.

<li id="fn:3">The earliest black-and-white ornamental mosaics often imitated other types of pavements in motif and composition, and they may have been used as a substitute for the more expensive polychrome mosaics.

<li id="fn:4">Moretti and Sgubini Moretti 1977, plates 35–36, 39–42. The new preferences that begin to appear in mosaics about 20 BC also parallel changes in taste in wall painting: polychromy and three-dimensional decorative motifs disappear and are replaced by flat black-and-white designs and figural styles; see Clarke 1991, 61–63.

Ostia, the port of Rome, provides the most extensive evidence for the development of mosaic pavement types following the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79; many examples date to the second and early third centuries AD. The vast majority of these are black-and-white figural mosaics, often with marine subjects, as in the Baths of Neptune (Clarke 1979, figs. 31–34) and the Baths of the Lighthouse (Clarke 1979, figs. 69–71).
