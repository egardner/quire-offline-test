<h3 id="provenance">Provenance</h3>

<p>This mosaic was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1972 from Jeannette
Brun, a Zurich-based antiquities dealer, who reported that it had been in an
Italian collection but provided no further information regarding its provenance.
Subsequent publications attributed the work on stylistic grounds to a North
African atelier.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Recent archival research, however, indicates that the
mosaic was in fact unearthed in June 1901, in a vineyard in the vicinity of Lago
di Lucrino, north of Baiae and just west of Naples.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> At the time of
its discovery, architects and archaeologists at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale
in Naples suggested that the mosaic may have decorated the great room of a bath
but believed it had little artistic value and recommended against its
acquisition by the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Subsequently, the Italian state authorized the
landowner, Schiano Muriello, to sell the mosaic, and it was purchased in March
1906 by Ernesto Osta, a lawyer who intended to use it in the decoration of the
monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II in Rome. The mosaic was lifted from the
ground, but portions of it remained in situ owing to its poor condition and the
difficulty of removing it intact. The lifted mosaic remained in storage in
Naples, and in 1925 it was offered to John Marshall, a British art expert and
dealer in Rome. By 1929, Osta’s heirs sold it to Rodolfo Follis of Turin. Follis
sought ministerial permission to export the mosaic, but the legality of his
ownership was questioned.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Precisely when the mosaic left Italy is unknown.
Four other panels from the mosaic (figs. 2–5), which had been clandestinely
removed from the site and eventually recovered by Italian authorities, are now
in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples.</p>

<h3 id="commentary">Commentary</h3>

<p>The center of the preserved portion of the mosaic depicts a bear hunt. From the
left, three hunters wearing high boots, long-sleeved tunics, and short, belted
garments draped diagonally from the left shoulder drive five bears into a large,
semicircular net tied to a pair of trees. A fourth hunter appears on a panel now
in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples (fig. 5).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> His outstretched
left arm continues onto the left side of the Getty’s part of the mosaic (fig.
6). The others stand in similar poses, with legs bent and arms extended forward.
Three hold staffs in their right hands; three are beardless. Two of the figures
are accompanied by inscriptions identifying them as Lucius and Minus. A cord in
Minus’s left hand suggests that he is tying the net to a tree. The bears, like
the hunters, move to the right across different levels of ground. All the bears
have open mouths, and two have turned their heads back to the hunters, as if to
snarl at them. In addition to the two tall trees that frame the scene, other,
abbreviated landscape elements include darker tesserae representing the ground
in the lower level and some small plants and clumps of grass above. Cursory
shadows are also depicted, as are highlights and shading.</p>

<p>The figural scene is bordered by a colorful double <em>guilloche</em> consisting of
green, yellow, white, red, and black tesserae. Outside the <em>guilloche</em>, at
right, is a long, straight, vertical laurel festoon tied at center by a ribbon.
A third, outermost border consists of an exuberant acanthus rinceau inhabited by
fruit, armed cupids, and the protomes of real and imaginary animals, including a
horse, a panther, and a griffin. The two preserved corners are adorned with
large acanthus-enveloped faces (fig. 7), rather like personifications of the
Seasons but undifferentiated. On one of the four panels in Naples, a third,
smaller face emerges from the acanthus rinceau (fig. 2). This face was likely
located beneath and to the left of the hunters, and its almost fully frontal
orientation suggests that it may have originally marked the midpoint of the
entire mosaic, which must have included at least one additional scene; for while
the right side of the bear hunt terminates in a tree and the vertical festoon
beyond the double <em>guilloche</em> border, the left side evidently continued beyond
the tree between Minus and Lucius. Other large hunt mosaics of the period, such
as that from the Gardens of Licinius on the Esquiline Hill in Rome, also include
the netting of animals as part of more complex compositions consisting of
several different scenes.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Numerous ancient literary sources note the aristocratic taste for <em>venationes</em>.
The emperor Hadrian, who ruled from AD 117 to 138, is reported to have hunted
bears in both Greece and Asia Minor, and he is depicted hunting on horseback in
a roundel on the Arch of Constantine in Rome. The emperor even composed a poem,
later inscribed in stone, celebrating his success as a hunter. Bears were found
throughout the ancient Mediterranean world, however, and were captured to be
trained as well as slaughtered. The second-century AD treatise on hunting,
<em>Cynegetica</em>, by Pseudo-Oppian, describes in detail one method of netting bears
(although not the manner depicted in the Getty mosaic): driving them along a
rope hung with colored ribbons and feathers. The letters of the late
fourth-century AD consul Symmachus, among other sources, relate efforts to
procure bears and various beasts for public entertainment.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Klaus Werner, who
first recognized the Campanian origins of the Getty mosaic, and Maddalena Cima
have argued that this theme was a particular favorite of emperors who sponsored
spectacles with wild animals in the amphitheater.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:8"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The findspot of the Getty Bear Hunt mosaic has yet to be fully investigated. It
was discovered with a marble border and fragments of columns near the so-called
Stufe di Nerone, in the Scalandrone neighborhood north of Baiae. These
monumental architectural remains have been damaged by the construction of modern
streets and overbuilding and, consequently, are not well understood.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> The
early twentieth-century archaeologists who saw the Getty mosaic in situ made
additional soundings and estimated its full length to be at least twelve
meters.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:10"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> The unusual shape of the mosaic, with extended corners, suggests
that it may have occupied a space between two more or less oval rooms, such as
those used for baths or audience halls.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:11"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> The determination that this mosaic
once decorated a rich senatorial villa or an imperial residence must await
further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="comparanda">Comparanda</h3>

<p>Scenes of hunters forcing bears and other animals into nets and traps are
depicted on mosaics throughout the Roman Empire, including examples from
Carthage, El Kef, Hippo Regius and Utica in North Africa;
Centcelles in Spain; Villelaure in France; and Rome (including one from the
Esquiline Hill, noted above) and Ravenna in Italy.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:12"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> In
1973, Norman Neuerburg suggested a North African origin for the Getty mosaic,
although he also noted comparanda for its iconography in mosaics from the city
of Rome and elsewhere in Italy.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:13"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> A decade later, David H. Ball published the
mosaic, believing it to be of Tunisian origin and attributing it to a
Carthaginian workshop. He proposed that it depicted bears being captured for
display in the amphitheater, and he was particularly interested in the artists’
treatment of space and the possible source of the imagery, which, he believed,
derived from illustrated texts of Pseudo-Oppian’s <em>Cynegetica</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:14"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> At about
the same time as Ball’s study, Mario Pagano also published the mosaic, not
knowing that the majority of it had been acquired by the J. Paul Getty
Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:15"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup> Working from early reports, archival documents (including a
now-lost watercolor), and the four panels in Naples, Pagano compared its
composition to that of two mosaics in Sicily—the small hunt mosaic at the imperial villa
at Piazza Armerina and another from the Villa del Tellaro, near Heloros,
—as well as to others in North Africa. He also cited parallels for the populated
acanthus rinceau of the border on mosaics in Antioch (Turkey) and Argos
(Greece). The signature of the mosaicist T. Senius Felix from Puteoli
(present-day Pozzuoli, near Naples) on a large mosaic found at Lillebonne in
Gaul, dating to the late third or early fourth century AD, suggests that Puteoli
was home to workshops that drew upon designs of North African mosaics to
decorate the many splendid villas overlooking the Bay of Naples that belonged to
rich senatorial clients.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:16"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="condition">Condition</h3>

<p>The mosaic has been divided into multiple sections, all of which are backed with
concrete. Twenty-three panels are in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and four are in
the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples. When the Getty panels were first
lifted, in 1906 (a date confirmed by scraps of Italian newspaper still attached
to two of them), they were backed with concrete reinforced by iron rebar.
Correspondence between Jeannette Brun and Getty Museum officials in the early
1970s indicates that restoration of the panels was a condition of the purchase.
The restoration was completed in Zurich by mid-June 1972 with considerable
difficulty because of the size and number of panels. The concrete backings were
reinforced with additional rebar, which in some cases doubled the thickness of
the panels. When the mosaic arrived in Los Angeles, museum officials complained
to Brun about several aspects of this treatment, especially the lack of
alignment among the panels.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:17"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> The panels also seem to have been polished
smooth prior to the mosaic’s arrival. The mortar between the tesserae of one of
the corner panels depicting a face enveloped in acanthus (fig. 7) was
subsequently partially removed.</p>
