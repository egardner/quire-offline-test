&lt;p&gt;The mosaics of Italy first appeared in the late second century BC under the
influence of the Hellenistic Greek pictorial tradition, in which tiny pieces of
irregular stone were used to create narrative themes in detailed, colorful
compositions that imitated the effects of painting.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The earliest examples of
this type, most of which were &lt;em&gt;emblemata&lt;/em&gt;, or picture panels, were either
introduced to the region by Greek craftsmen or manufactured elsewhere and
imported. Found predominantly in the cities around the Bay of Naples and Rome
mosaics in this style, such as the well-known Alexander Mosaic from the House of
the Faun at Pompeii and the Nile Mosaic from Palestrina, both dating to about
100 BC, were considered expensive luxury items, reserved exclusively for the
decoration of the wealthiest constructions. Smaller &lt;em&gt;emblemata&lt;/em&gt; were usually
centerpieces of floors, and they were typically surrounded by plain white
tesserae or framed by simple decorative patterns. On some later floors, the
figural scene was set in a more elaborate design, such as in the House of the
Labyrinth at Pompeii, which features an &lt;em&gt;emblema&lt;/em&gt; of Theseus and the Minotaur
dating to about 70–60 BC and framed by a black-and-white labyrinth pattern.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the first century BC, the production of mosaic pavements in
various new Roman styles became widespread throughout Italy. The tremendous
expansion in the use of mosaics to decorate both public and private buildings
resulted in a number of different types that ranged from colorful figural scenes
to predominantly black-and-white geometric and floral patterns.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Villa of
the Volusii Saturnini at Lucus Feroniae, north of Rome, includes both styles:
polychrome mosaics in a phase of the villa dated to about 60–50 BC contrasting
with black-and-white pavements from the period of about AD 10–20.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Black-and-white style mosaics, like the Getty’s Mosaic Floor with Head of Medusa
(cat. 1), however, became increasingly common by the late first century AD,
especially in Rome and central Italy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Complex geometric designs, like the
intricate pattern of curvilinear triangles encircling the bust of Medusa in this
mosaic, now covered the floors of entire rooms. Stylized vegetal motifs, used in
similarly themed compositions, such as the detailed floral pattern that
surrounds the central head of Medusa in a mosaic decorating the floor of the
&lt;em&gt;triclinium&lt;/em&gt; in the House of Bacchus and Ariadne at Ostia, were equally
prevalent.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Although this new decorative style may have served as a less
expensive solution to the more costly tesserae required for polychrome mosaics,
in the second century AD black-and-white patterned mosaics of extremely high
quality were also used in the decoration of Hadrian’s Villa at Tivoli and in the
Palazzo Imperiale at Ostia.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing popularity of the black-and-white mosaic style in Italy in the first
and second centuries AD had a strong impact on mosaic designs outside of Italy,
particularly in the Roman provinces of Gaul and North Africa. The introduction
and diffusion of this style in these regions in the first century AD can most
likely be attributed to the increasing Roman presence in the region; itinerant
craftsmen traveled or settled in the area and established workshops for mosaic
production. Around the beginning of the fourth century AD, however, provincial
workshops exerted a profound influence in Italy, even in Rome itself, bringing a
new preference for large-scale scenes of the hunt or the arena to luxurious
Italian villas. The Getty’s fourth-century AD Mosaic Floor with Bear Hunt (cat.
2), from a seaside villa near Baiae on the Bay of Naples, exemplifies this new
style, which was particularly characteristic of mosaics in North Africa during
this period. The North African influence is also evident in the Great Hunt
mosaic at Piazza Armerina in Sicily and in a hunting mosaic from the Gardens of
Licinius on the Esquiline Hill in Rome, both dating to the early fourth century
AD, which in turn derive from the third-century AD hunting mosaics, such as
those from Carthage, Thysdrus (present-day El Djem), and the Villa of the
Laberii at Oudna.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;This technique, known as &lt;em&gt;opus vermiculatum&lt;/em&gt;, appeared as early as the third century BC in Sicily and then spread north throughout Italy. On the origins of these types of pavements, see the discussion in Phillips 1960, 243–62. For a general history of mosaics in Sicily, see von Boeselager 1983.

 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;The earliest black-and-white ornamental mosaics often imitated other types of pavements in motif and composition, and they may have been used as a substitute for the more expensive polychrome mosaics.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;Moretti and Sgubini Moretti 1977, plates 35–36, 39–42. The new preferences that begin to appear in mosaics about 20 BC also parallel changes in taste in wall painting: polychromy and three-dimensional decorative motifs disappear and are replaced by flat black-and-white designs and figural styles; see Clarke 1991, 61–63.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Ostia, the port of Rome, provides the most extensive evidence for the development of mosaic pavement types following the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79; many examples date to the second and early third centuries AD. The vast majority of these are black-and-white figural mosaics, often with marine subjects, as in the Baths of Neptune (Clarke 1979, figs. 31–34) and the Baths of the Lighthouse (Clarke 1979, figs. 69–71).

&lt;h3 id=&#34;provenance&#34;&gt;Provenance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mosaic originally decorated the floor of a Roman villa in one of two
adjacent rooms, both with similar mosaics, discovered on the Via Emanuele
Filiberto in Rome. The site was excavated by Angelo Pasqui in 1910, but it is
uncertain when the mosaic was removed.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was purchased by the J. Paul Getty
Museum in 1971.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;commentary&#34;&gt;Commentary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A colorful female bust is the only polychrome feature in this otherwise
black-and-white mosaic. Snakes around her neck and serpentine locks of hair
identify her as the Gorgon Medusa. The image decorates the central medallion of
the mosaic, with the face turned upward and to the right. An elaborate geometric
pattern encircles the bust: concentric bands of alternating black-and-white
triangles decrease in size as they spiral toward the center, creating the
optical illusion of spinning motion. The design has also been interpreted as a
shield of scales, a reference to the aegis worn by Athena, a scaly mantle
decorated with the head of Medusa. A &lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt; border around the circle is
enclosed within a second, square &lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt; that outlines the entire
composition. &lt;em&gt;Kantharoi&lt;/em&gt; fill the triangular spaces at each of the four corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Greek mythology, the Gorgon Medusa was a fearsome monster who turned viewers
to stone with her gaze. When she was finally killed—beheaded by the hero
Perseus—her hideous head was presented to his patron goddess, Athena. The Gorgon
head was a popular apotropaic device in Greek art, as its terrifying appearance
was believed to ward off evil. In Roman art, however, Medusa was humanized and
more clearly female; at times she was even depicted in the form of a beautiful
woman. During the Roman period, the image of the Gorgon often served a primarily
decorative function in interior decoration, appearing, for example, on domestic
utensils and wall paintings, but it continued to be regarded as a protective
symbol. Representations of Medusa were often accompanied by imagery related to
the god of wine, Dionysos, whose worship invoked pleasure and good fortune. The
&lt;em&gt;kantharoi&lt;/em&gt; found in the corners of the Getty mosaic are closely associated with
the revelries of Dionysos. A Roman mosaic from &amp;ldquo;Kisamos,&amp;rdquo;, on Crete, similarly
depicts the central bust of Medusa surrounded by panels of masks and followers
of Dionysos.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; An explicit connection appears in a late second-century AD
mosaic pavement from a Roman villa at Corinth, which features the head of
Dionysos at the center of the same pattern found on the Getty mosaic and a
&lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt; border with &lt;em&gt;kantharoi&lt;/em&gt; in the corners.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Getty’s Medusa mosaic originally decorated a small room measuring 3.6 × 2.9
meters. A pendant mosaic (fig. 1) survives from an adjacent, larger room (5.3 ×
4.5 meters) of the same villa; it was most likely made by the same workshop and
is now in the collection of the Museo Nazionale Romano—Palazzo Massimo alle
Terme.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This second mosaic depicts the bust of Medusa in mirror image, her
gaze turned upward to the left. Her head is also placed at the center of a
black-and-white shield or spinning wheel design. Birds perch on branches in the
four corners instead of &lt;em&gt;kantharoi&lt;/em&gt;, and a pattern of stylized tendrils and
ornate scrolls frames the &lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt; border. The excavation of this villa
revealed that the two rooms originally formed one large rectangular chamber
decorated with a black-and-white mosaic of a marine scene before it was
subdivided and redecorated with the pair of Medusa mosaics.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Although the
reason for the renovation or reconstruction of the villa is unknown, the
construction of the building in &lt;em&gt;opus mixtum&lt;/em&gt;, a technique used especially
during the rule of the emperor Hadrian from AD 117 to 138, indicates that the
transformation likely took place sometime in the early second century AD.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The style of the mosaics is typical of private villas in Italy during this
period, which were decorated predominately with black-and-white mosaics made up
of complicated, often curvilinear geometric patterns and highly stylized floral
designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparanda&#34;&gt;Comparanda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circular geometric design with the Gorgon head at its center was used
frequently on mosaic pavements throughout the Roman Empire. Many were colorful,
polychrome compositions. In second-century AD mosaics from Piraeus in Greece and
Pergamon in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), the triangles of the scale pattern
are rendered in shades of red, blue, green, and yellow, with a &lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt;
border in yellow and blue.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The example from Pergamon&lt;/span&gt;, like the Getty
mosaic, also displays &lt;em&gt;kantharoi&lt;/em&gt; in its four corners. In a variation on the
spinning aspect of the design, the curvilinear triangles encircling the head of
Medusa in a late second-century AD mosaic floor from the House of the Red
Pavement at Antioch form concentric petal shapes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Scale patterns could also
be composed of shapes other than triangles. A mosaic from the *triclinium of a
Roman villa at Marcianopolis in Thrace (present-day Devnya, in Bulgaria), known
as the House of Antiope, displays Medusa within a circular pattern of
spade-shaped scales surrounded by a meander pattern, with felines in
each of the corners.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Comparable examples from North Africa include a Roman
villa at Thysdrus (present-day El Djem) and a bath complex at Dar Zmela, both
characterized by a similar pattern of spade-shaped scales and flower motifs in
the corners, as well as the Great Baths at Thaenae, (present-day Thina), decorated with
radiating waves of alternating colors.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; An unusual version of this design in
&lt;em&gt;opus sectile&lt;/em&gt; was discovered at in southern Turkey, where it covered the floor
of the orchestra of an &lt;em&gt;odeion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bouleuterion&lt;/em&gt; that was destroyed in the
fifth or sixth century AD.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Although other examples of the shield or
spinning wheel motif appear in &lt;em&gt;opus sectile&lt;/em&gt;, all feature a geometric pattern
in place of the head of Medusa. One of these, executed in polychrome marble, was
found in the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum, the famous Roman villa that
inspired the design and decoration of the Getty Villa in Malibu.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;condition&#34;&gt;Condition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central medallion is largely intact, but the edges, including the two
vessels in the lower half of the mosaic and much of the border, appear to be
modern reconstructions. Reportedly, the mosaic was already badly damaged when it
was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;For the excavations of the villa, see Pasqui 1911, 338–39. It seems that the mosaic may have been reburied and lifted later. Period photographs in the Getty curatorial files, including one labeled “Casa dei Neroni,” show the mosaic as the floor of a modern house, but the location and previous owner have not yet been identified.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;provenance&#34;&gt;Provenance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mosaic was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1972 from Jeannette
Brun, a Zurich-based antiquities dealer, who reported that it had been in an
Italian collection but provided no further information regarding its provenance.
Subsequent publications attributed the work on stylistic grounds to a North
African atelier.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Recent archival research, however, indicates that the
mosaic was in fact unearthed in June 1901, in a vineyard in the vicinity of Lago
di Lucrino, north of Baiae and just west of Naples.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At the time of
its discovery, architects and archaeologists at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale
in Naples suggested that the mosaic may have decorated the great room of a bath
but believed it had little artistic value and recommended against its
acquisition by the museum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Subsequently, the Italian state authorized the
landowner, Schiano Muriello, to sell the mosaic, and it was purchased in March
1906 by Ernesto Osta, a lawyer who intended to use it in the decoration of the
monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II in Rome. The mosaic was lifted from the
ground, but portions of it remained in situ owing to its poor condition and the
difficulty of removing it intact. The lifted mosaic remained in storage in
Naples, and in 1925 it was offered to John Marshall, a British art expert and
dealer in Rome. By 1929, Osta’s heirs sold it to Rodolfo Follis of Turin. Follis
sought ministerial permission to export the mosaic, but the legality of his
ownership was questioned.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Precisely when the mosaic left Italy is unknown.
Four other panels from the mosaic (figs. 2–5), which had been clandestinely
removed from the site and eventually recovered by Italian authorities, are now
in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;commentary&#34;&gt;Commentary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center of the preserved portion of the mosaic depicts a bear hunt. From the
left, three hunters wearing high boots, long-sleeved tunics, and short, belted
garments draped diagonally from the left shoulder drive five bears into a large,
semicircular net tied to a pair of trees. A fourth hunter appears on a panel now
in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples (fig. 5).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; His outstretched
left arm continues onto the left side of the Getty’s part of the mosaic (fig.
6). The others stand in similar poses, with legs bent and arms extended forward.
Three hold staffs in their right hands; three are beardless. Two of the figures
are accompanied by inscriptions identifying them as Lucius and Minus. A cord in
Minus’s left hand suggests that he is tying the net to a tree. The bears, like
the hunters, move to the right across different levels of ground. All the bears
have open mouths, and two have turned their heads back to the hunters, as if to
snarl at them. In addition to the two tall trees that frame the scene, other,
abbreviated landscape elements include darker tesserae representing the ground
in the lower level and some small plants and clumps of grass above. Cursory
shadows are also depicted, as are highlights and shading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figural scene is bordered by a colorful double &lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt; consisting of
green, yellow, white, red, and black tesserae. Outside the &lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt;, at
right, is a long, straight, vertical laurel festoon tied at center by a ribbon.
A third, outermost border consists of an exuberant acanthus rinceau inhabited by
fruit, armed cupids, and the protomes of real and imaginary animals, including a
horse, a panther, and a griffin. The two preserved corners are adorned with
large acanthus-enveloped faces (fig. 7), rather like personifications of the
Seasons but undifferentiated. On one of the four panels in Naples, a third,
smaller face emerges from the acanthus rinceau (fig. 2). This face was likely
located beneath and to the left of the hunters, and its almost fully frontal
orientation suggests that it may have originally marked the midpoint of the
entire mosaic, which must have included at least one additional scene; for while
the right side of the bear hunt terminates in a tree and the vertical festoon
beyond the double &lt;em&gt;guilloche&lt;/em&gt; border, the left side evidently continued beyond
the tree between Minus and Lucius. Other large hunt mosaics of the period, such
as that from the Gardens of Licinius on the Esquiline Hill in Rome, also include
the netting of animals as part of more complex compositions consisting of
several different scenes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous ancient literary sources note the aristocratic taste for &lt;em&gt;venationes&lt;/em&gt;.
The emperor Hadrian, who ruled from AD 117 to 138, is reported to have hunted
bears in both Greece and Asia Minor, and he is depicted hunting on horseback in
a roundel on the Arch of Constantine in Rome. The emperor even composed a poem,
later inscribed in stone, celebrating his success as a hunter. Bears were found
throughout the ancient Mediterranean world, however, and were captured to be
trained as well as slaughtered. The second-century AD treatise on hunting,
&lt;em&gt;Cynegetica&lt;/em&gt;, by Pseudo-Oppian, describes in detail one method of netting bears
(although not the manner depicted in the Getty mosaic): driving them along a
rope hung with colored ribbons and feathers. The letters of the late
fourth-century AD consul Symmachus, among other sources, relate efforts to
procure bears and various beasts for public entertainment.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Klaus Werner, who
first recognized the Campanian origins of the Getty mosaic, and Maddalena Cima
have argued that this theme was a particular favorite of emperors who sponsored
spectacles with wild animals in the amphitheater.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findspot of the Getty Bear Hunt mosaic has yet to be fully investigated. It
was discovered with a marble border and fragments of columns near the so-called
Stufe di Nerone, in the Scalandrone neighborhood north of Baiae. These
monumental architectural remains have been damaged by the construction of modern
streets and overbuilding and, consequently, are not well understood.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
early twentieth-century archaeologists who saw the Getty mosaic in situ made
additional soundings and estimated its full length to be at least twelve
meters.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The unusual shape of the mosaic, with extended corners, suggests
that it may have occupied a space between two more or less oval rooms, such as
those used for baths or audience halls.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:11&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The determination that this mosaic
once decorated a rich senatorial villa or an imperial residence must await
further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparanda&#34;&gt;Comparanda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenes of hunters forcing bears and other animals into nets and traps are
depicted on mosaics throughout the Roman Empire, including examples from
Carthage, El Kef, Hippo Regius and Utica in North Africa;
Centcelles in Spain; Villelaure in France; and Rome (including one from the
Esquiline Hill, noted above) and Ravenna in Italy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:12&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In
1973, Norman Neuerburg suggested a North African origin for the Getty mosaic,
although he also noted comparanda for its iconography in mosaics from the city
of Rome and elsewhere in Italy.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A decade later, David H. Ball published the
mosaic, believing it to be of Tunisian origin and attributing it to a
Carthaginian workshop. He proposed that it depicted bears being captured for
display in the amphitheater, and he was particularly interested in the artists’
treatment of space and the possible source of the imagery, which, he believed,
derived from illustrated texts of Pseudo-Oppian’s &lt;em&gt;Cynegetica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:14&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At about
the same time as Ball’s study, Mario Pagano also published the mosaic, not
knowing that the majority of it had been acquired by the J. Paul Getty
Museum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:15&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Working from early reports, archival documents (including a
now-lost watercolor), and the four panels in Naples, Pagano compared its
composition to that of two mosaics in Sicily—the small hunt mosaic at the imperial villa
at Piazza Armerina and another from the Villa del Tellaro, near Heloros,
—as well as to others in North Africa. He also cited parallels for the populated
acanthus rinceau of the border on mosaics in Antioch (Turkey) and Argos
(Greece). The signature of the mosaicist T. Senius Felix from Puteoli
(present-day Pozzuoli, near Naples) on a large mosaic found at Lillebonne in
Gaul, dating to the late third or early fourth century AD, suggests that Puteoli
was home to workshops that drew upon designs of North African mosaics to
decorate the many splendid villas overlooking the Bay of Naples that belonged to
rich senatorial clients.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:16&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;condition&#34;&gt;Condition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mosaic has been divided into multiple sections, all of which are backed with
concrete. Twenty-three panels are in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and four are in
the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples. When the Getty panels were first
lifted, in 1906 (a date confirmed by scraps of Italian newspaper still attached
to two of them), they were backed with concrete reinforced by iron rebar.
Correspondence between Jeannette Brun and Getty Museum officials in the early
1970s indicates that restoration of the panels was a condition of the purchase.
The restoration was completed in Zurich by mid-June 1972 with considerable
difficulty because of the size and number of panels. The concrete backings were
reinforced with additional rebar, which in some cases doubled the thickness of
the panels. When the mosaic arrived in Los Angeles, museum officials complained
to Brun about several aspects of this treatment, especially the lack of
alignment among the panels.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:17&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The panels also seem to have been polished
smooth prior to the mosaic’s arrival. The mortar between the tesserae of one of
the corner panels depicting a face enveloped in acanthus (fig. 7) was
subsequently partially removed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The province of Gallia Narbonensis, in the southern part of Gaul (present-day
France), was one of the earliest regions of the Roman Empire to be affected by
Greek and Roman culture. Even before the Roman conquest of the late second
century BC, there was a significant Greek presence in the region, notably at
Massalia (present-day Marseille), a Greek colony founded about 600 BC. The
earliest examples of mosaics and other decorated floors in Gaul, dating to the
first century BC, are found in this region, beginning with simple types related
to the Italian &lt;em&gt;opus signinum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;terrazzo&lt;/em&gt;. Mosaics composed of tesserae
became more prevalent in the late first and early second centuries AD, and it is
likely that the technique was introduced by itinerant craftsmen, who established
workshops in the region. The development of mosaic styles that followed this
early period—specifically, the appearance of the black-and-white style mosaics
that were widespread in Italy—reflects the rapidly expanding Roman presence in
the region. Local craftsmen soon integrated their own designs and compositions,
however, resulting in the distinctive Gallo-Roman style that was characteristic
of the workshops operating in the Rhône valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest mosaics of this Gallo-Roman type date to the middle of the second
century AD. At that time, the main centers of mosaic production in Gaul were
located in the upper Rhône valley at Lugdunum (present-day Lyon) and around
Vienne, especially in its suburbs of Saint-Romain-en-Gal, and Sainte-Colombe,
where workshops are thought to have continued production through the early third
century AD. These workshops developed the so-called multiple decor design, with
individual figures or scenes isolated in an elaborate grid-like framework
resembling a coffered ceiling.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The &lt;em&gt;emblema&lt;/em&gt; of the Getty mosaic of Orpheus
and the Animals (cat. 3) exemplifies the Gallic multiple decor style, with
different figures from the myth of Orpheus inhabiting adjoining hexagons.
Notably, however, the surrounding field of black-and-white geometric patterns
continues to reflect the influence of Italian traditions (see fig. 8) for
the mosaic with its complete border). Another mosaic, also from Vienne, with a
central panel depicting the drunkenness of Herakles, displays a more developed form
of multiple decor composition. The main scene is surrounded by square panels
containing an extraordinary variety of designs that draw upon the extensive
decorative repertory of the Rhône workshops.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to standard
mythological subjects, scenes of contemporary Roman life are also characteristic
of mosaics in the upper Rhône valley. A number of mosaics depict episodes from
daily life, such as farming and hunting, as well as chariot races and other
spectacles from the arena.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Representations of these activities were adapted
to the multiple decor design by filling in the compartments with figural groups,
often acting in a series of related events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the main production centers in Gaul were in the upper Rhône valley, an
active mosaic culture, dependent primarily on the workshops of
Aix-en-Provence,also existed in the cities farther south.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The surviving
evidence suggests that a more conservative stylistic tradition developed in the
south; significantly, the multiple decor style is relatively infrequent there. A
mosaic from the rue des Magnans in Aix-en-Provence is a notable exception, in
which panels with various geometric patterns surround a scene of the boxing
match between Dares and Entellus—the same image depicted on the Getty mosaic
(cat. 4).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The majority of the Aix-en-Provence mosaics, however, are
monochrome pavements consisting of white floors outlined by simple black
borders. Although fewer in number, examples of black-and-white geometric designs
were also seen in this period, reflecting the Italian influence in this part of
Gaul as well.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A few mosaics from this area, found almost exclusively in
wealthy villas, include colorful central panels with detailed figural
scenes.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many mosaics from the upper Rhône valley depict scenes of Roman life,
examples from Aix-en-Provence and its vicinity usually illustrate subjects from
mythology or literature. Certain themes used in the mosaics from this area are
highly original. The combat between Dares and Entellus depicted on the Getty
mosaic is an episode from Virgil’s &lt;em&gt;Aeneid&lt;/em&gt; (5.362–482) that is relatively
unknown outside of southern Gaul.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, a second mosaic from the same
villa, now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, represents a specific scene
from Ovid’s &lt;em&gt;Metamorphoses&lt;/em&gt; (2.401–530)—Diana discovering the pregnant
Callisto—that has no counterpart in known Roman mosaics.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Both mosaics
represent distinctly Roman versions of mythology, and their uncommon themes may
indicate local preferences associated with this particular area of Gaul.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:10&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;For a general discussion of the features of the Gallo-Roman style, see Lancha 1981, 14–16 (with inventory numbers) and a summary in Dunbabin 1999, 74–78. In addition to the multiple decor style, Lancha identifies two additional characteristics: the use of elaborate floral and vegetal elements, and the use of figural scenes and motifs not present in previous Gallic mosaics.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;Lancha 1981, 106–16, no. 306, plates 40–44, dates the mosaic (now in the Museé de la Civilisation Gallo-Romaine, Lyon) to the last quarter of the second century AD.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;Lancha 1981, 15–16, lists statistics for common mythological themes, such as Orpheus, Dionysos, Herakles, the Seasons, and the Muses. For examples of farming scenes, see Lancha 1981, 208–25, no. 368, plates 107–23. For chariot races, see Lafaye 1909, nos. 712, 785, 1236. For events from the amphitheater, see Lafaye 1909, nos. 1072, 1295, 1611.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;Aix has the greatest number of preserved mosaics in Gaul after Lugdunum and Vienne; see Lavagne 2000, 13–14: Aix (129 mosaics), Lyon (156 mosaics), Vienne, Saint-Romain-en-Gal (212 mosaics).
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;Lavagne 1994, 203–15, dated to the mid-second century AD. The pavement lacks anything like the floral designs or the small figural motifs incorporated into examples from Vienne. Regarding the relationship between the rue des Magnans decoration and Vienne, Henri Lavagne asserts that the rue des Magnans mosaic anticipates the multiple decor style that is fully developed in the Vienne workshops; see Lavagne 2000, 17.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;Lavagne 2000, 13–14, provides fifty-five examples of monochrome pavements and fourteen examples of black-and-white designs. Despite the high proportion of monochrome mosaic pavements in the region, expensive pavements in &lt;em&gt;opus sectile&lt;/em&gt; were the preferred form of decoration in the numerous luxury Roman villas in this area. Lavagne notes six examples in Aix that, according to him, were made by an Italian workshop, and fifty-five examples total from southeastern Gaul; see Lavagne 2000, 13–14.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34;&gt;Lavagne 2000, 13–14, records fourteen examples with figures, all from Aix.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:8&#34;&gt;Examples of the Dares and Entellus mosaic in Gaul are discussed in cat. 4, in the present volume.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:9&#34;&gt;Lavagne discusses the scene in the Diana and Callisto mosaic, citing two examples from wall paintings in Pompeii: the House of the Tragic Poet (VI, 8, 3.5) and the House of the Hanging Balcony (VII, 12, 26–27); see Lavagne 2000, 313, no. 916.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:10&#34;&gt;The mosaics from Villelaure (approx. twenty miles north of the modern town of Aix-en-Provence) were likely produced by the workshops of Aix-en-Provence. The early history of the discovery and excavation of the nearby site is summarized in “Villelaure: History of the Excavations,” in the present volume.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:10&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
